The Unofficial Marvel PHP Library
==========

This is a helper library for the Marvel Comics API - http://developer.marvel.com/


This isn't official but should generally work except for the incomplete items in the TODO list below.

All characters - no matter how awesome they are - are owned by Marvel Comics. Also, if you use this library, make sure you follow their attribution rules: http://developer.marvel.com/documentation/attribution

### Installing via Composer

The recommended way to install the Marvel library is through [Composer](http://getcomposer.org).

```bash
# Install Composer
curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php

# Add the library as a dependency
php composer.phar require caseysoftware/marvel-helper ~2.0
```

or alternatively, you can add it directly to your `composer.json` file.

```json
{
    "require": {
        "caseysoftware/marvel-helper": "~2.0"
    }
}
```

Then install via Composer:

```bash
composer install
```

Finally, require Composer's autoloader in your PHP script:

```php
require __DIR__.'/vendor/autoload.php';
```

To use any of the examples, rename credentials-dist.php to credentials.php and add your API key from here: https://developer.marvel.com/account

## Notes

*  The character name search doesn't support wildcards but you can use terms like 'nameStartsWith' to perform more interesting searches like finding every instance of 'Spider-Man' by just using 'Spider'.
*  So far the optional parameters have no validation in this library... I'm not sure if it should occur here as it may break later versions of the API as those requirements change.
